# NoSQL-tools MCP Server (`nosqltools-mcp-server.py`)

## üöß CAUTION & DISCLAIMER

> **Not for Production ‚Äî For Experimental/Education Use Only**
>
> This MCP server interacts with OCI NoSQL resources and can expose, modify, or delete data.  
> **You are solely responsible for correct setup, permissions, and data security.**
>
> - **DO NOT USE with production data or environments.**
> - **No guarantee of data privacy or regulatory compliance** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
> - **Review, audit, and sanitize all activity and results.**
> - Before using any third-party tools/scripts (like `anonimizer*.py`), ensure they meet your legal, privacy, and security standards.
>
> *No warranty is provided. Use at your own risk and in accordance with your organization's legal, security, and privacy policies.*

## Why Use This Tool?

This project enables hands-on exploration of AI and NoSQL data workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), such as rapid prototyping, learning, and proof-of-concept demos.  
**Experiments with private, compliance-approved LLMs can unlock powerful automation and data insights‚Äîprovided you follow responsible security and privacy practices.**

## Key Risks and Security Practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è AI & LLM Data Exposure Warning

- **LLMs may inadvertently reveal or retain any data you provide‚Äîincluding confidential or sensitive data.**
- **Never connect LLMs to production data.** Use only masked/sanitized test data for experimentation.
- Prefer **private LLMs** (deployed within your own organization) to minimize data risk and maximize compliance and control.
- **Consult with your compliance and security teams before enabling LLM-based workflows for any business data.**

### Security Quick Checklist

- Use least-privilege OCI accounts and assign only necessary permissions.
- Regularly review and audit logs, outputs, and queries for privacy breaches or anomalies.
- Carefully vet all external dependencies (libraries, scripts, anonymization tools) for security, privacy, and licensing before use with sensitive information.
- The included anonymizer script (`anonimizer*.py`) is a demonstration only‚Äî**thoroughly review and adapt before use; it does not guarantee compliance or full anonymization.**

---

## Features

- Compartment management: List and retrieve compartments.
- NoSQL operations: List, describe, and query NoSQL tables.
- Built-in SQL guardrails for safer experimentation.

---

## Intended Use

This repository is a **proof of concept** for integrating MCP servers with OCI NoSQL.  
It is intended exclusively for local experimentation, technical exploration, and demonstrations.  
**Never use with production data or environments.**

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [`fastmcp`](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol/fastmcp/) (via `requirements.txt`)
- [OCI Python SDK (`oci`)](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/pythonsdk.htm)
- [NoSQL SDK (Borneo)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/25.1/java-driver/index.html)
- OCI credentials/config file

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Set up your OCI configuration**
    - Edit `~/.oci/config` as described in the OCI SDK documentation.

---

## MCP Server Configuration

Register the server with your MCP client.  
Example JSON entry for Claude UI on Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbtools": {
      "command": "C:\\Python\\python.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\user1\\nosql-ai-proof-of-concept\\nosqltools-mcp-server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The server runs using stdio transport and can be started by running:

```
fastmcp run nosqltools-mcp-server.py:mcp
```

## API Tools

You can use MCP inspector to explore the API Tools provided

The [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/tools/inspector)  is an interactive developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. 



## Example Prompts

You can use prompts such as: 

```
"There‚Äôs an MCP server named nosqltools"
"List all tables in davega compartment"
"Please let me view the first 20 lines in the table called sessiontable"
"Can you provide me those data as a table"
"Can you provide me those data in JSON format"
"can you read the data in the table AgentInventoryEntity"
"What about the data in test_ddb_complex"
```

This project has been tested with MCP-compatible clients such as Claude Desktop.
See https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user  for more examples.

## Further Guidance 
- When using anonymization scripts, always manually review outputs for adequacy and compliance.
- In regulated or sensitive environments, always consult with your legal, privacy, and compliance teams before deploying, adapting, or integrating any LLM- or AI-based workflow with your data or systems.
- For important business automation or anonymization needs, prefer professionally supported tools rated for enterprise use and compliance.
